# NotProton

NotProton enables the Steam Play experience from Linux Steam in the macOS Steam client.

This is done by forcibly enabling the Steam Play functionality in macOS Steam (which is
present and inert) as well as by porting some components of Valve's Proton to macOS.

This tool is intended to be used with Steam Client 1788652215 or 1790121765 and **CrossOver 26.3 or CrossOver Preview
20261006 or 2026082**. Both the FEX and the Rosetta versions are supported. I recommend using the FEX version of the 
Preview 20261006, as it includes both the FEX version as well as the Rosetta one. 

This fork also supports the free [Highball](https://github.com/gauthierpiarrette/Highball)
Wine 11 engine `x64-crossover26.3-r23` on Apple Silicon with Rosetta. Install that
engine through Highball, then open NotProton and select **Set Up Compatibility Tool**.
In Steam, select **Highball Wine 11 r23 — Rosetta** for the game's compatibility tool.
NotProton copies the complete engine into its own runner directory; it does not
change Highball's bottles or source engine. This path uses DXMT and requires no
CrossOver activation. Wine 10 and other engine builds are not supported by this port.
Automatic app updates are disabled in this fork so an upstream build cannot replace it.

The macOS app itself is located in the ```app``` folder. The core logic is in ```dylib```.
```lsteamclient``` is a macOS port of Valve's lsteamclient. ```steam-shim```is a port of Valve's
steam-helper from Proton 9. ntdll-patch patches the copy of CrossOver that the app
makes/places in the ```~/Library/Application Support/notproton/runners/``` folder so that
lsteamclient is loaded.

This release is coming several days past when I wanted to release it, so the
documentation is quite sparse. Sorry about that, I'll improve it shortly. For real this time.

Please open issue reports with any issues. PRs are welcome and encouraged. Contributions policy to come shortly.

There are many people who worked on similar ideas, similar projects. I did not base NotProton on their work, but I still want to 
give thanks to the people who came before me:

[Nat Brown](https://github.com/natbro) made [Kaon](https://github.com/natbro/kaon), which is similar in goals to NotProton.

mont127's [Neutron](https://github.com/mont127/Neutron) is also a similar idea, but implemented differently. 

[Gio](https://github.com/giodotblue) was working enabling Steam Play inside of Steam on macOS prior to the release of NotProton itself. 
I would have done things differently had I been aware of that. 

Thanks to everyone who has positively contributed to macOS gaming.
